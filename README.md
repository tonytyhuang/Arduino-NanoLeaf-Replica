# Creating a Nanoleaf replica

I decided to create a replica of the Nanoleaf by connecting individually addressable LEDS to an ESP32 arduino board and controlling it through the code I wrote interacting with the Blynk App giving access to controlling the lights through WiFi.

Created a Nanoleaf replica using WS2812b individually addressable lights and controlled by integration with the Blynk app.
